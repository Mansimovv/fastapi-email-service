First of all, your "main.py" and ".env" must both be in the same directory, otherwise the FastApi code will not be able to read the .env package.

To run the code, type
uvicorn main:app --reload

After running it in the terminal, you can add "/docs" to the end of the URL code and click on the "try it out" button on the right to execute the code.
Good luck!
