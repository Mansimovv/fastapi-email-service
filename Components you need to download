First, we need to download Python itself.
  https://www.python.org/downloads/

VS Code Extension
  Python (Microsoft)
  FastAPI 

What we need to install with "pip"(Python Package Installer)
  pip install fastapi         # The main FastAPI framework (for building APIs)
  pip install uvicorn        # ASGI server to run FastAPI applications
  pip install python-dotenv  # Loads environment variables from .env files
  pip install email-validator  # Validates email address formats
